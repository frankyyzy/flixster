### Notes
I was stuck for a while as the poster images are not showing up after I followed the tutorial. I then realized that I didn't put the size after the URL.
Another issue I had is that I made a typo about a variable and after I realized it and changed all instances of the variable the code won't compile. I later realized that it's the problem that the objects are not associated with the correct variables any more as the variable is an outlet for label in my main storyboard.
